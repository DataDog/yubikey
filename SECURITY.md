## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you’ve discovered a bug in Datadog’s security,

and usually earlier.
Our [PGP key](https://www.datadoghq.com/8869756E.asc.txt) is available for download in case you need to encrypt communications with us.
We request that you not publicly disclose the issue until we have had a chance to address it.
