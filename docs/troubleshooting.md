## Blocked card

If you are blocked out of using GPG because you entered your PIN wrong too
many times (3x by default), **donâ€™t panic**: just [follow the
instructions](https://github.com/ruimarinho/yubikey-handbook/blob/master/openpgp/troubleshooting/gpg-failed-to-sign-the-data.md)
here. Make sure you enter your **Admin PIN** correctly within 3x, otherwise
your current keys are blocked, and you must reset your YubiKey to use new keys.

## Error with git pull/fetch or when using SSH

If you try to ssh or git pull/fetch and you have the following error:
```
sign_and_send_pubkey: signing failed: agent refused operation
```
You are probably mistyping your PIN. To verify it, you can:
```
gpg --card-edit
gpg/card> verify
...
PIN retry counter : 3 0 3 # if it is the right PIN
PIN retry counter : 2 0 3 # if it is a wrong PIN
...
```
If your PIN is wrong, try 123456, which is the default PIN.
If it still fails, reset your PIN:
```
gpg --card-edit
gpg/card> admin
gpg/card> passwd
gpg: OpenPGP card no. D2760001240102010006055532110000 detected

Your selection? 1
PIN changed.

1 - change PIN
2 - unblock PIN
3 - change Admin PIN
4 - set the Reset Code
Q - quit

Your selection? q
```

## git rebase

If you are using the FIPS model, you can perform signing operations for 15
seconds after touching your YubiKey before having to touch it again. When
running a large git rebase, you may have to touch your YubiKey multiple times.
If the rebase seems to hang and the YubiKey flashes, it means you need to touch
it again.

If you are still having issues when rebasing, you might consider using
the `--no-gpg-sign` flag as a [workaround](https://github.com/DataDog/yubikey/issues/19).

## No PyUSB backend detected

If you see the following error while running `./gpg.sh`:

```
Usage: ykman [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
Try "ykman -h" for help.

Error: No PyUSB backend detected!
```

Hit CTRL-C to exit the script (if the script has not already exited) and [reinstall](https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-manager/issues/185#issuecomment-446379356) `libsub`, then try again: `brew reinstall libusb`

## Bad substitution

If you see the following error while running `./gpg.sh`:

```
OS detected is macos
Is it correct ? (y|N) Y
env.sh: line 34: ${OS,,}: bad substitution
```

Run `brew install bash`. The script is using a feature not that is not supported by the old macOS bash.

## Operation not supported by device error

This manifests as PIN Entry dialog prompting to insert the card in a perpetual loop.

You may also see:

```shell
gpg --card-status
gpg: selecting card failed: Operation not supported by device
gpg: OpenPGP card not available: Operation not supported by device
```

Run [./scdaemon.sh](../scdaemon.sh).

## Please insert the card with serial number

This happens when the card is inserted, then you try to make a commit, but it can't be signed.

You may get a system popup that says something like this:

```
Please insert the card with serial number:
00 000 000
```

Where `00 000 000` is the serial number of your security card. 

**Solution**

First, you have to make sure that the card is recognized by your computer. 
For doing so:

Plug the card and then type `gpg --card-edit` on the terminal.
If the card is detected, you'll see something like:

```
Serial number ....: 00000000
```

Make sure that the number that appeared in the popup matches this one.

Also take note about the signature key that looks like this:
```
Signature key: ABCD 1234 ABCD 1234  ABCD 1234 ABCD 1234
```

If you remove the whitespaces, it should match the signature that git 
is using for signing the commits (use `git config --global user.signingkey` 
for getting the key). But in this case, it may look different:

```
$ git config --global user.signingkey
XYZZ0000XYZZ0000XYZZ0000XYZZ0000
```

If the numbers don't match, as shown above, then assign the signature key 
that you got from the `gpg --card-edit` command without whitespaces.

```
git config --global user.signingkey ABCD1234ABCD1234ABCD1234ABCD1234
```
